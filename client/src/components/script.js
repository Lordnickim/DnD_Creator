  partOne: 'Welcome Adventurer! Your story is just beginning in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. Before setting off on your quest you need to create your character. To help set the mood I’ve created a story to help manifest your hidden character waiting to venture forth. Behold! Before lies the toughest tarven in all the land The Salty Spitoon! Only the strongest adventurers may enter or be turned away to the tarven of Weenie Hut Jr, but wait! What class do you possess that may enter such an establishment? And do you have enough strength to open these heavy doors?',
  partTwo:'You see inside a most bustling tarven with all kinds of folk from dwarfs having drinking contests with horned tieflings to half-orcs and elves playing cards. The is no limit to all walks of life here at the Salty Spitton, however it is at this moment you yourself cant remember what you look like. You walk to the bar and order some Ale while looking at the mirror. Which race do you see inside the mirror? Will you have enough wisdom to also realize when to stop drinking?',
  partThree: 'The barkeep walks up to you and asks "Don\'t believe I\'ve seen you around here. What do you go by stranger?"

Do you have the charisma to leave an impression for all to hear?',
  partFour: 'You pay no attention to the noble, but instead their big plump coin purse. You begin to wonder if you have enough Dexterity to "compensate" that nobles earlier actions. How quick and skillful do you think you can grab some coin? However! What are your morales? May you be Good or Evil? or maybe just Nuetral?',
  partFive: 'The Mage slides a giant tome your way and says "I have no issues with petty theft, but I need an extra pair of eyes to help my unlock this spell inside the tome." You look at the spell inside, but only a true master of Intelligence can unlock the secrets inside. Do you have the brains Adventurer? Pherhaps your mysterious background can aid you in the strange writings?',
  partSix: 'The Unspeakable Horror charges toward you ready to rip limb from limb! After all you been through is it the end before it even begun? Will you have enough Constitution to survive?'
